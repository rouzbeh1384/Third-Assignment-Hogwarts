## Build Process

I first came and made a plan for the project so that I know what I need and what I should do, after that I started writing. I did every single class.
After some places where I had to change the road, I did so

## problem
these are some problem in my project that   encountered   

1-  set courses: for student my first opinion is saving  a class of  courses in student  so this thing dont work if my plan has time I will check it .by the way i save name of courses in Array list that type is string   

2-  game Hogwarts :I have not seen haripater yet so i dont know about game my opinin is a onther game that ask question and if correct answer increase a grade of student 

3-  Grade :becaese I save the name courses I cant use it  .I create another  String Arraylist and save such as it "Grade courses" --"12 math" after that by use regex i get grade for calculate GPA  

4- remover courses :for this problem when you remove  a courses I search in all student and check their courses if they have this course .I add "this courses remove " after name courses 

5-Game:Assistant can write question for student and student can solve them .

6-Check the feature :this is the hardest section for this project because for test i should make a assistant after make a student and courses, and then  I can test feature of student our Teacher .
I use try catch in function  for if conterde to a problem print "NOT successful"

7-Remove :after  student remove a course it should be remove in plan So for this problem I use regex for find this courses in plan Array after find remove it   

8-set grade :after teacher choose the student show the courses that student had then choose the course and enter grade 

9-i show the plan of courses that student had
