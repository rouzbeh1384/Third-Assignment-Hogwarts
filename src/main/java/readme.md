1-  set courses: for student my first opinion is saving  a class of  courses in student  so this thing dont work if my plan has time I will check it .by the way i save name of courses in Array list that type is string   

2-  game Hogwarts :I have not seen haripater yet so i dont know about game my opinin is a onther game that ask question and if correct answer increase a grade of student 

3-  Grade :becaese I save the name courses I cant use it  .I create another  String Arraylist and save such as it "Grade courses" --"12 math" after that by use regex i get grade for calculate GPA
